Hangman Animal Edition-FinalProject

Code Louisville- Software Development 1

This project is a simple game of Hangman (Animal Edition) contained within the console. The player is first greeted with a message welcoming them to the game.
The player is then prompted to make their first guess while also given the hint that all the animals they will guess will contain 5 letters (to make it easy for them).
After the player makes their first guess, they will know whether their guess was correct or incorrect. If the guess is correct then the letter they guess will show.
If the guess is incorrect, the player will be asked to guess a different letter. The player is granted 6 lives/guesses;If the player does not guess the correct word within 6 tries, they lose the game.
If the player inputs more than one letter at a time, then they will be asked to only input a single letter (no lives will be taken away). If the player guesses the correct word within 6 tries, they win!.
